- _config.yml: Site configuration file. You can configure most settings here.
- scafoolds: When you create a new post, Hexo bases the new file on the scaffold.
- source: Where you put your siteâ€™s content. Hexo ignores hidden files and files or folders whose names are prefixed with _ (underscore) - except the _posts folder. Renderable files (e.g. Markdown, HTML) will be processed and put into the public folder, while other files will simply be copied.
